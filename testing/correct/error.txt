   us a specific one.

5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.

I ran
$ java -ea enigma.Main test/correct/01-reduce.config test/correct/01-reduce.in
in IntelliJ and I have a nuew line char in the end of output.

However, when I ran it in terminal or on instructional machine, I dont have it.
This caused a bad exit code in AG. I'm wondering why.

I think "\\s+" would match a next line char for me, so that I can choose to add it to my output. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
